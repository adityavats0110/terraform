# Cloud Load Balancer Modules

<!-- NOTE: We use absolute linking here instead of relative linking, because the terraform registry does not support
           relative linking correctly.
-->

This repo contains modules to perform load balancing on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Google Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/).

## Quickstart

If you want to quickly spin up a HTTP Load Balancer with multiple backends, you can run the example that is in the root of this repo. Check out the [http-multi-backend example documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/examples/http-multi-backend) for instructions.

## What's in this repo

This repo has the following folder structure:

* [root](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/tree/master): The root folder contains an example of how to deploy a HTTP Load Balancer with multiple backends. See [http-multi-backend example documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/examples/http-multi-backend) for the documentation.

* [modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/modules): This folder contains the main implementation code for this Module.

  The primary modules are:

    * [http-load-balancer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/modules/http-load-balancer) is used to create an [HTTP(S) External Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/) using [global forwarding rules](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/global-forwarding-rules).
    * [internal-load-balancer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/modules/internal-load-balancer) is used to create an [Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/) using [internal forwarding rules](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/#forwarding_rule).
                                                                                                                                           
* [examples](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/examples): This folder contains examples of how to use the submodules.

* [test](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/test): Automated tests for the submodules and examples.



## What is Cloud Load Balancing?

[Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/) is a fully distributed, software-defined, managed service for all your traffic. It is not an instance or device based solution, so you wonâ€™t be locked into physical load balancing infrastructure or face the HA, scale and management challenges inherent in instance based LBs. Cloud Load Balancing features include:  

* **HTTP(S) Load Balancing:** HTTP(S) load balancing can balance HTTP and HTTPS traffic across multiple backend instances, across multiple regions.
* **Network TCP/UDP Load Balancing:** load balance external traffic.
* **Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing:** load balance internal traffic.
* **Seamless Autoscaling:** Autoscaling helps your applications gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduces cost when the need for resources is lower.
* **Cloud CDN Integration:** Enabling [Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/) for HTTP(S) Load Balancing for optimizing application delivery for your users.
* **Stackdriver Logging:** Stackdriver Logging for load balancing logs all the load balancing requests sent to your load balancer.

You can learn more about Cloud Load Balancing in [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/).

## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.


## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, along
with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-load-balancer/releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
